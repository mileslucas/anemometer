\section{Methods} \label{sec:methods}

The adaptive optics (AO) system operates in a telescope's pupil plane, which is the focal length that images the pupil, or entrance, of the telescope (as opposed to an object at infinity for the focal plane). In single conjugate AO, where the wavefront is measured from the same target as the science instrument (usually a bright natural guide star), the AO system receives collimated light. The collimated beam of light has traveled through a column of atmosphere as seen projected onto a pupil-plane image (\autoref{fig:pupil}). Atmospheric cells reflect and refract this late, causing the amplitude and phase of the wavefront to become incoherent. These wavefront errors are precisely what is measured by the AO system using a pupil-plane image from the wavefront sensor. Since the atmospheric cells are affected by the wind, the corresponding wavefront error will translate across the pupil. An example of this translation is shown in \autoref{fig:motion}.

The light enters Earth's atmosphere and will refract through the various atmospheric cells in the column of air above the telescope pupil. Wind can move these cells over time. This column appears projected in the pupil plane, as shown by the image on the right. This shows the pupil of the Subaru coronagraphic extreme AO (SCExAO) wavefront sensor \citep{guyon_wavefront_2011}.}

Here a ``blob" of wavefront errors, which corresponds to a particular atmospheric cell in the column of air above the pupil, translates about 7 pixels between 400 frames, which corresponds to a wind speed of $\sim$\SI{6}{\meter\per\second} according to the SCExAO loop speed and pupil geometry.}

So, if we can consistently measure the offset between frames we can derive the wind speed. Before addressing how we measure the offsets between frames, let's discuss how we calculate the wind speed from pixel offsets. The SCExAO pupil is an image of the Subaru primary mirror, which is \SI{8.2}{\meter} in diameter. The pupil-plane images we use span this distance with $\sim$48 pixels, so the pupil platescale is approximately \SI{0.17}{\meter\per\pixel}. If there is precise timing information for each frame, we can use that to determine the time delay between frames-
\begin{equation}
    v = \Delta_\mathrm{px} \cdot \frac{ps_\mathrm{pupil}}{t}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta_\mathrm{px}$ is the offset measured in pixels, $ps_\mathrm{pupil}$ is the pupil platescale, and $t$ is the time between frames. We can also use the real-time controller loop rate $f_\mathrm{RTC}$ (e.g., \SI{2}{\kilo\hertz}) to find the average time between $N$ frames-
\begin{equation}
    v = \Delta_\mathrm{px} \cdot \frac{ps_\mathrm{pupil} \cdot f_\mathrm{RTC}}{N}
    \label{eqn:quantity}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Measuring offsets in images} \label{sec:algo}

The previous section derived a formula for wind speed above the telescope pupil but glossed over how to actually measure the offset (or translation) between frames. One of the obstacles to overcome in our data is the effect of the pupil geometry; the pupil shape is effectively a mask. Already this has an effect on our algorithm for deriving wind speeds: if we are measuring offsets between frames sufficiently far apart in time, it is possible that a blob has moved entirely across the pupil, which would be impossible to measure, giving us a maximum measurable wind speed for a given time step (or, equivalently, for the number of frames).
\begin{equation}
    v_\mathrm{min} = \frac{8.2\mathrm{ m} \cdot f_\mathrm{RTC}}{N}
    \label{eqn:max}
\end{equation}

One measure for determining how similar two images are is their cross-correlation \citep{1997ApOpt..36.8352F}.
\begin{equation}
    \chi_{i} = \sum_{j}{f_{i}g_{j}}
    \label{eqn:crosscorr}
\end{equation}
where $\chi$ is the cross-correlation map, and $f$ and $g$ are the images in question. The index of the maximum value of $\chi$ corresponds to the amount of translation between $f$ and $g$. 

As mentioned previously, the pupil geometry acts like a mask for our images, which needs to be addressed when using the cross-correlation for measuring offsets. Imagine, for any given frame, there will always be zero signal outside of the pupil, which means that two frames will have extremely high measures of similarity. Since the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of these regions is effectively infinite, we want to mask these regions out and let the signal from \textit{within} the pupil drive our cross-correlation. \citet{2012ITIP...21.2706P} derives an efficient cross-correlation algorithm using a bitmask for the two images. We use the implementation from \verb|scikit-image| \citep{2014arXiv1407.6245V} in conjunction with the pupil geometry bitmask stored on the SCExAO control computer.

One consequence of using our masked cross-correlation algorithm is that we can't measure offsets less than half-pixel between frames. The discrete pixels in our images ``bin" the cross correlation map and any offset less than \SI{0.5}{\pixel} gets binned to \SI{0}{\pixel}. This gives us a natural minimum detectable wind speed
\begin{equation}
    v_\mathrm{min} = 0.5\mathrm{ px}\cdot\frac{ps_\mathrm{pupil} \cdot f_\mathrm{RTC}}{N}
    \label{eqn:min}
\end{equation}
In addition, we derive a finite resolution (the bin size) for the wind speed
\begin{equation}
    \delta v = 1\mathrm{ px} \cdot\frac{ps_\mathrm{pupil} \cdot f_\mathrm{RTC}}{N}
    \label{eqn:resolution}
\end{equation}

Combining \autoref{eqn:max} and \autoref{eqn:min} helps guide our choice of how far apart we should measure frames for offsets. SCExAO typically operates at \SI{2}{\kilo\hertz}, and we expect wind speeds to be between $\sim$\SIrange{0}{60}{\meter\per\second}. Using every 300th frame ($N=300$) would give a minimum detectable speed of \SI{0.6}{\meter\per\second} and maximum detectable speed of \SI{55}{\meter\per\second}. In practice, we found that using every 400th frame ($N=400$) worked well.

As mentioned with regards to the pupil geometry, any static signal between images will dominate the cross-correlation compared to any moving signal. To help alleviate this, we perform multiple pre-processing steps to our data before measuring the masked cross-correlation. The SCExAO control computer can save \textit{pseudo-open-loop} frames as a cube of images, with $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ frames per cube (which only corresponds to tens of seconds due to high loop rate). Pseudo-open-loop frames are used because they represent the highest S/N of wavefront errors in the pupil plane and have already been processed and filtered by the SCExAO real-time controller to remove systematics (like the deformable mirror flat frames).

Our first pre-processing step is to subtract out a median frame from the data cube, which helps remove static structure that may corrupt the cross-correlation. Without this step, we find that even the most trivial of datasets cannot effectively retrieve offsets between frames; removing static signal is paramount to having a bias-free cross-correlation. Another step we take to remove further static signal is filtering low-order Zernike modes out of our data. We do this because we expect the translational signal to be high spatial frequency, and we need to remove as much non-translational signal as possible. Another spatial filter we apply is a Gaussian high-pass filter. We accomplish this by convolving a Gaussian with \SI{5}{\pixel} spatial standard deviation and 1 frame temporal standard deviation to our data, and then subtracting this output from the cube. We found this chain of pre-processing is sufficient for testbed data and is a promising start for on-sky data, which will be discussed in \autoref{sec:onsky}. The full algorithm is listed in Algorithm~\autoref{alg:windspeed}.
