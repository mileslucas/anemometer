	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the theoretical properties of high-contrast coronagraphic images in the context of exoplanet searches. We derive and analyze the statistical properties of the residual starlight in coronagraphic images and describe the effect of a coronagraph on the speckle and photon noise. Current observations with coronagraphic instruments have shown that the main limitations to high-contrast imaging are due to residual quasi-static speckles. We tackle this problem in this paper and propose a generalization of our statistical model to include the description of static, quasi-static, and fast residual atmospheric speckles. The results provide insight into the effects on the dynamic range of wave front control, coronagraphy, active speckle reduction, and differential speckle calibration. The study is focused on ground-based imaging with extreme adaptive optics, but the approach is general enough to be applicable to space, with different parameters.}

	abstract = {Atmospheric wavefront prediction based on previous wavefront sensor measurements can greatly enhance the performance of adaptive optics systems. We propose an optimal linear approach based on the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) framework commonly employed for atmospheric predictions. The approach offers increased robustness and significant performance advantages over previously proposed wavefront prediction algorithms. It can be implemented as a linear pattern matching algorithm, which decomposes in real time the input (most recent wavefront sensor measurements) into a linear sum of previously encountered patterns, and uses the coefficients of this linear expansion to predict the future state. The process is robust against evolving conditions, unknown spatio-temporal correlations and non-periodic transient events, and enables multiple sensors (for example accelerometers) to contribute to the wavefront estimation. We illustrate the EOFs advantages through numerical simulations, and demonstrate filter convergence within 1 minute on a 1 kHz rate system. We show that the EOFs approach provides significant gains in high contrast imaging by simultaneously reducing residual speckle halo and producing a residual speckle halo that is spatially and temporally uncorrelated.},

In addition to unusual optics, achieving high contrast at this small angular separation requires a wavefront sensing and control architecture which is optimized for exquisite control and calibration of low order aberrations. The SCExAO system was thus designed to include the wavefront sensors required for bias-free high sensitivity and high speed wavefront measurements. Information is combined from two infrared wavefront sensors and a fast visible wavefront sensors to drive a single MEMS type deformable mirror mounted on a tip-tilt mount. The wavefront sensing and control architecture is highly integrated with the coronagraph system.},
